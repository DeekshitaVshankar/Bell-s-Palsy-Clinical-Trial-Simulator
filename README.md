**Bell's Palsy's Clinical Trial (Life Sciences Domain)**


This Power BI dashboard analyses treatment outcomes using real-world-style clinical trial data. It is tailored to simulate use cases relevant to our life sciences clients such as Plus Project UK and OncoDrug UK.

*Problem Statement*

In the life sciences sector, clinics and pharmaceutical clients often struggle to monitor treatment outcomes at scale and translate them into actionable insights. Spreadsheets, fragmented data, and lack of visual context limit strategic decisions and compliance-readiness.

*Purpose*

- Patient outcome tracking
- Treatment effectiveness comparison
- Time-sensitive decision-making
- Compliance-readiness (e.g. audit-level access)
- Custom analytics with role-based visibility

*Project Summary*

This dashboard evaluates the effectiveness of treatments by analysing patient recovery scores, time to treatment, and overall improvements. It helps uncover patterns in recovery timelines, track treatment success rates, and support compliance with industry regulations.
Rather than building flashy visuals, the aim is to provide clarity, audit-ready reporting, and scalable insights that can be adapted for client-facing healthcare and life sciences use cases.

*Use Case Overview*

This dashboard mimics real client scenarios, helping internal teams or external clients monitor clinical performance, review patient data, and ensure regulatory compliance.

*Consultant's Vision and Future Enhancements*

From a consultancy lens, this dashboard can evolve into a packaged analytics solution:

- Line-level & role-based security for compliance with NHS, MHRA, and GDPR standards
- Automation workflows using Power Automate (e.g. alerts if score dips below a threshold)
- Client SharePoint Site: To embed dashboards and host document templates
- Power App Forms: For nurses or researchers to input new records from mobile/tablet
- Multi-client readiness: Easily replicable structure for other life sciences companies
- Audit-ready logs & change tracking
- Can be positioned as “BI as a Service” (BIaaS) for small and medium research units
